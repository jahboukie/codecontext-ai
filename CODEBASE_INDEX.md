## 1. Top-Level Packages / Subsystems

| Area | Path | Stack | Responsibility |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| (Removed Cloud Backend) | `backend/` (deleted) | (Removed) | All Firebase/Stripe functionality removed ‚Äì purely local edition |
| CLI | `cli/` | Node.js + Commander + TS | Developer UX: commands for init, login, execute, search, memory, status, upgrade |
| Execution Engine | `execution-engine/` | Express + Secure Worker sandbox | Sandboxed multi-language execution + security + memory learning |
| Semantic / Code Intelligence (mostly in CLI) | `cli/src/services/*` | Local embeddings, vector store, parsing | Code indexing, semantic + hybrid search, dependency graphs, concept extraction |
| Dashboard (placeholder) | `dashboard/` | Static HTML | (Early stub) Potential future web UI |
| Docs / Plans | `*.md` root + plans | Markdown | Architecture, security, spatial intelligence, TODOs |
| Test Utilities | `battle-test-suite.js`, `enhanced-security-tests.js` | Node scripts | Security & robustness testing harnesses |

## 2. Cloud Backend (Removed)

All Firebase Functions, Firestore usage, Stripe webhooks and remote quota validation were intentionally removed for the Local Edition. Execution & indexing limits plus feature gating now occur purely via local JSON state inside the project (`.codecontext/subscription.json`) and an optional sponsorship marker (`.codecontext/sponsor.json`).

There are no network calls, telemetry, or remote authentication flows. The previous `backend/` directory has been deleted.

---
## 3. CLI Commands (Representative)

Located in `cli/src/commands/`:
- `init` ‚Äì Project initialization (writes `.codecontext` config).
- `execute` ‚Äì Rich local execution surface (templates, streaming, sessions, auto dependency detection, friendly errors) ‚Äì always offline.
- `run` ‚Äì Wrapper / simplified execution (not fully inspected here).
- `context`, `search` ‚Äì Token / semantic context retrieval & search.
- `memory` ‚Äì Team / individual memory operations.
- `record` ‚Äì Records something (likely conversation/execution context).
- `status` ‚Äì Shows local usage (exec/file counts) & sponsor state.
- `sponsor` ‚Äì Explains sponsorship model & how to enable higher limits.
(Removed legacy commands: `login`, `upgrade`).

CLI Supporting Services (`cli/src/services/` key ones):
-- (Removed) `apiClient.ts` ‚Äì previously talked to remote API.
-- `subscriptionManager.ts` ‚Äì Tracks and records execution/file usage locally; (sponsor-aware planned).
- `enhancedExecutionService.ts` ‚Äì Orchestrates local/cloud execution: language detection, templates (`api-call`, `data-analysis`, `web-server`), dependency inference, session state, friendly errors.
- `semanticCodeSearchEngine.ts` ‚Äì Hybrid semantic/textual/structural/conceptual search; integrates:
  - `embeddingService.ts`
  - `vectorStore.ts` / `faissStore.ts` (FAISS adapter?)
  - `codeContentIndexer.ts` (function/class/file extraction)
  - `dependencyGraphBuilder.ts` (call/import relationships)
  - `codeIntelligenceDatabase.ts` (SQLite or similar structured store) 
- Memory Engines: `memoryEngine.ts`, `teamMemoryEngine.ts`, `semanticMemoryEngine.ts`, `semanticTeamMemoryEngine.ts` ‚Äì Execution + team knowledge retention & pattern mining.
- `contextualSuggestionEngine.ts` ‚Äì Suggests related code (improves AI prompts).

Config / Persistence:
- `.codecontext/` project folder for config + sessions + usage tracking + sponsor flag.

## 4. Execution Engine (`execution-engine/`)

Entry: `src/index.ts`
- Express API: `/execute`, `/history`, `/patterns/:language`, `/errors/:language`, `/performance/:language`, `/health`, `/security/status`.
- Integrates `SecureExecutionEngine` + `ExecutionMemoryManager`.

Security Layer: `secureExecutionEngine.ts`
- Uses Worker Threads isolation + `mainSecurityManager` (not fully inspected) to sandbox JS.
- Enforces memory limits, timeout, captures console, collects violations, returns `securityReport` + improvement suggestions.
- Current secure path supports only JavaScript eval (non-JS code gets ‚ÄúLanguage not supported‚Äù in secure mode) ‚Äì mismatch with advertised multi-language support (JS/TS/Python/Go/Rust). Multi-language is an aspirational claim; real support incomplete.

Memory Integration: `memoryIntegration.ts` (not expanded here) ‚Äì Predicts success probability, stores execution outcomes, suggests improvements.

---
## 5. Semantic Intelligence / Indexing Flow (High-Level)

1. Parse project ‚Üí extract functions, classes, files (AST-based in `codeContentIndexer.ts`).
2. Store structural metadata in `codeIntelligenceDatabase.ts` (likely SQLite; fields: complexity, lines, embeddings, concepts).
3. Generate embeddings (embedding service) ‚Üí Persist in vector store (FAISS or JSON fallback) for semantic similarity search.
4. Build dependency graph (imports, calls) enabling structural / relationship queries.
5. Hybrid search merges textual (SQL LIKE), semantic (vector similarity), conceptual (concept extraction table), structural (patterns) results ‚Üí rank ‚Üí insights.

---
## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern | Current State | Notes / Gaps |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Authentication | None (local trust) | Login removed; optional sponsor.json honor system. |
| Authorization | Local file-based gating | Free vs sponsor limits enforced pre-execution. |
| Billing | Community sponsorship (honor system) | No payment integration in code. |
| Usage Quotas | Local JSON counters | Free: 40 exec / 50 files; sponsor tier (planned uplift). |
| Security (Execution) | Secure Worker + manager | Non-JS languages not sandboxed (gap vs marketing); no network / fs policy enumeration in index. |
| Security (API) | Basic checks | Lacks rate limiting, audit logs, abuse alerts. |
| Data Privacy | Credentials stored locally with restrictive perms | Need encryption at rest (optional) and key rotation guidance. |
| Error Handling | Mixed (try/catch, console.error) | Central structured logging absent. |
| Observability | None (intentional) | Telemetry removed for privacy; future optional opt-in. |
| Testing | Few ad-hoc test scripts | Missing automated unit/integration tests for critical paths (execute validation, Stripe events, secure engine sandbox escapes). |
| Docs | Several strategic docs | Need Quickstart, Security model overview, API reference, ‚ÄúVibe Flow‚Äù onboarding doc. |
| Packaging | CLI exists (published?) | Need version pinning, release script, binary or npx story. |
| CI/CD | Not visible | Add pipeline: lint + build + minimal test + deploy functions. |
| Windows Support | Likely (Node-based) | Confirm path & permission handling (fs mode 0o600 on Windows is advisory only). |

## 7. MVP Surface (Proposed for "Vibe Coders")

Prioritize flow speed, minimal friction, immediate ‚ÄúAI augmented execution win‚Äù.

Essential User Stories:
1. Install CLI (`npm i -g codecontext-pro` or npx) and run `ctx execute --code "console.log('hi')"` locally (no auth) ‚Üí instant success.
2. Create account on minimal web page ‚Üí copy API key ‚Üí `ctx login`.
3. Run cloud-gated execution requiring validation (e.g., with memory or semantic search) ‚Üí usage decremented.
4. Run `ctx search "function to validate stripe webhook"` ‚Üí get ranked results.
5. View usage & tier: `ctx status`.

Secondary (Nice-to-Have for MVP+):
- Session-based execution state (`--session`) persistence.
- Template-driven natural language run (`--run "create a web server on port 4000"`).
- Basic semantic memory suggestions on failed executions.
- Security score surfaced in CLI execution results.

Deferred (Post-MVP):
- Multi-language secure sandbox (Python/Go/Rust actual support).
- Team memory synchronization & dashboard UI.
- Conceptual / structural advanced search insights UI.
- Automated dependency installation w/ license compliance checks.

## 8. Immediate Risks / Technical Debt (Pre-Ship Fix List)

1. Secure engine language claims vs actual implementation (only JS) ‚Äì adjust wording or add minimal Python support path.
2. Lack of logging structure ‚Äì introduce lightweight JSON logger (local only) for execution engine.
3. File indexing quota enforcement not yet implemented ‚Äì enforce before large repo indexing.
4. Credentials file permission semantics on Windows (0o600 not enforced) ‚Äì document alternative (OS guidance).
5. Need unit tests for subscription gating & semantic search scoring.
6. Potential future web dashboard security considerations (if reintroduced) ‚Äì plan ahead.

## 9. Recommended Local Edition Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Implement sponsor tier limit uplift in SubscriptionManager.
- [ ] Add CLI version flag.
- [ ] Enforce file indexing limit (block when exceeding free tier).
- [ ] Update docs: Quickstart (install ‚Üí execute ‚Üí search ‚Üí sponsor optional).
- [ ] Document security model (sandbox boundaries, unsupported languages, no telemetry policy).
- [ ] Add minimal opt-in metrics flag (future; keep default none).
- [ ] Basic unit tests: subscription gating, execution path, semantic search ranking.

## 11. High-Level Directory Inventory (Condensed)

```
backend/                (Removed ‚Äì legacy Firebase/Stripe layer)
cli/                    CLI source (commands + services)
execution-engine/       Secure execution service (Express + sandbox + memory)
dashboard/              Static placeholder
*.md                    Architecture & planning docs
test-*                  Experimental test harness scripts
```

---
## 12. Open Questions (To Clarify Before Launch)

1. Pricing enforcement beyond execution count (file indexing limits enforcement path?).
2. Are developer keys intended for internal use only? Need rotation & audit story.
3. Cloud execution path ‚Äì is there currently a remote execution API, or only local sandbox + quota check? (CLI hints at cloud mode.)
4. Do we need basic analytics (daily active CLI users, executions) for early retention tracking? 
5. Final product name differentiation: "CodeContext Pro" vs "Vibe Coders" branding layer ‚Äì marketing alignment.

---
## 13. Summary

The codebase has strong early foundations in: local quota-gated execution, rich CLI ergonomics, semantic code indexing, and a security-conscious sandbox (JS). Primary blockers to a Local Edition release are polish (sponsor tier uplift, version flag), language support clarity, and basic test coverage. Address the Hardening Checklist and you have a compelling privacy-first developer tool.
