# 🧠 CodeContext AI - The Cursor Killer

## Revolutionary AI Assistant with Persistent Memory + Execution

**Stop paying for AI amnesia. Give your AI assistant persistent memory superpowers.**

---

## 🚀 What Is This?

CodeContext AI is the first AI coding assistant that **NEVER FORGETS ANYTHING**. While Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot suffer from goldfish memory, CodeContext AI remembers every conversation, architectural decision, and code pattern across all sessions.

### The Problem with Current AI Assistants:
❌ **Goldfish Memory** - Forget everything between sessions  
❌ **No Code Verification** - Suggest untested code  
❌ **No Learning** - Can't learn from project outcomes  
❌ **No Context** - Don't understand your project decisions  

### CodeContext AI Solution:
✅ **Perfect Memory** - Remembers everything forever  
✅ **Auto-Execution** - Tests all code suggestions  
✅ **Intelligent Learning** - Learns from every interaction  
✅ **Architectural Awareness** - Tracks project decisions

## 🔥 Features That Kill The Competition

### 🧠 **Persistent Memory Engine**
- Remembers all conversations across sessions
- Stores architectural decisions with rationale
- Tracks successful code patterns
- Builds project knowledge graph

### 🤖 **Multi-AI Integration**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Best reasoning and code generation
- **GPT-4** - Alternative provider for comparison
- **Provider Switching** - Use the best AI for each task
- **Response Comparison** - See Claude vs GPT side-by-side

### 🚀 **Sandboxed Execution Engine**
- Executes all code suggestions safely
- Verifies code works before storing
- Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust
- Real-time performance metrics

### 💬 **Interactive Chat Mode**
- Persistent memory across conversations
- Real-time code execution and verification
- Project context awareness
- Architectural decision tracking

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
npm install -g codecontext-ai
```

### 2. Setup AI Providers
```bash
codecontext ai setup
# Enter your Claude/GPT API keys
```

### 3. Start Using
```bash
# Chat with AI that remembers everything
codecontext ai chat "Add user authentication to my React app"

# Interactive mode with persistent memory
codecontext ai interactive

# Compare Claude vs GPT responses
codecontext ai chat "Optimize this function" --compare

# Execute and verify all suggestions
codecontext ai chat "Write a payment webhook" --execute
```

---

## 🎯 Example: Memory in Action

**First Conversation:**
```bash
$ codecontext ai chat "Remember: we use Stripe for payments with webhook validation"
🧠 Stored architectural decision: Stripe payments with webhook validation
```

**Later Session (Days/Weeks Later):**
```bash
$ codecontext ai chat "I need to handle failed payments"
🧠 Retrieved memories: Stripe payment decision
🤖 Based on your Stripe architecture, here's how to handle failed payments...
```

**The AI remembers your decisions and builds on them intelligently!**

## 🛠 Advanced Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
codecontext ai interactive
# Persistent chat with memory across the session
```

### Provider Comparison
```bash
codecontext ai chat "Implement OAuth" --compare
# See Claude vs GPT responses side-by-side
```

### Memory Management
```bash
codecontext memory --show     # View stored memories
codecontext memory --export   # Export project knowledge
codecontext status            # See memory statistics
```

### Code Execution
```bash
codecontext ai chat "Write a REST API" --execute
# Auto-executes and verifies all generated code
```

## 🔑 API Keys Setup

You'll need API keys from:
- **Anthropic** (for Claude): https://console.anthropic.com/
- **OpenAI** (for GPT): https://platform.openai.com/

Both are optional - you can use just one provider.

## 🚀 Why This Changes Everything

**Traditional AI Assistants:**
1. You ask a question
2. AI gives an answer (maybe wrong)
3. **AI forgets everything**
4. Repeat from step 1

**CodeContext AI:**
1. You ask a question  
2. AI recalls relevant project history
3. AI gives contextual answer
4. AI executes and verifies the code
5. **AI stores the successful pattern**
6. **AI builds on this knowledge forever**
