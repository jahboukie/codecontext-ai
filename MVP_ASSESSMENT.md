# MVP Readiness Assessment – CodeContext Pro (Vibe Coders Focus)

Date: 2025-08-12

## 1. Target Persona ("Vibe Coders")
Creative, rapid iteration developers who want:
- Instant local run of AI-suggested snippets.
- Fast semantic recall of project code.
- Light memory of previous attempts/errors.
- Minimal signup friction; optional cloud features gated by API key.

## 2. Core MVP Value Loop
1. Install CLI → 2. Execute code (local) → 3. See result & improvements → 4. Login (unlock quotas & memory / search scale) → 5. Semantic search aids next iteration.

## 3. Current Strengths
- Robust execution CLI with sessions, templates, auto deps, friendly errors.
- Semantic search design supports hybrid + conceptual + structural modes.
- Secure sandbox design (for JS) with violation reporting & scoring.
- Usage quota enforcement transactional – reduces gaming.
- Developer key pathway for internal testing and demos.

## 4. Gaps Blocking MVP Launch (Must Fix)
| Gap | Risk | Action |
|-----|------|--------|
| Duplicate Stripe webhook code | Double processing / runtime error | Remove duplicate fragment, add idempotency check |
| API URL naming inconsistency (`api/api`) | Confuses clients / docs | Standardize base path & update `apiClient.ts` |
| Unsupported claimed languages | Trust dilution | Either implement minimal Python support or adjust messaging |
| No automated tests for critical flows | Regressions unnoticed | Add 3–5 high-value tests (see Section 6) |
| No rate limiting / abuse prevention | Quota drain / cost | Basic per-IP + per-key request throttling |
| Quota only for executions | Overuse of indexing risk | Enforce file indexing quota in indexing path |

## 5. Nice-to-Have (Defer If Time-Constrained)
- Telemetry (execution latency histogram, search count).
- Session diff viewer.
- Concept insights summarization in CLI.
- Minimal web dashboard (usage visualization).

## 6. Minimal Test Plan (High ROI)
1. Execution quota increments + denies at limit (Firestore transactional test with mock). 
2. Developer key bypass (unlimited path). 
3. Stripe webhook signature validation + subscription tier update. 
4. Secure execution blocks unsupported language (returns deterministic error). 
5. Semantic search returns same cached results on repeated query (cache hit path).

## 7. Recommended Documentation Set
- Quickstart (install, local execute, login, search, secure run). 
- CLI Reference (commands + flags table). 
- Security Model (Sandbox limitations & non-JS story). 
- Billing & Quotas (tiers, limits, reset schedule). 
- Troubleshooting (common errors + suggestions). 

## 8. Launch Readiness Scorecard
| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Loop | 70% | Works locally; cloud distinction ambiguous.
| Security | 60% | Sandbox strong for JS; marketing vs capability gap.
| Reliability | 45% | Lacks automated regression tests.
| Documentation | 40% | Strategic docs exist; developer-first quickstart missing.
| Billing | 65% | Stripe events wired; duplication bug & lack of idempotency.
| Search Quality | 65% | Architecture rich; need user-facing simplification & examples.
| DX Polish | 55% | Good flags; needs doctor command + error taxonomy.

## 9. 5-Day Hardening Sprint (Sample Plan)
Day 1: Stripe handler cleanup, base URL normalization, add idempotency storage (Firestore `stripeEvents`).
Day 2: Implement / adjust messaging for language support; add tests 1 & 2; introduce simple logger.
Day 3: Add tests 3–5; rate limiting middleware (token bucket in memory + fallback Firestore counter by key).
Day 4: Enforce file indexing quota; write Quickstart + Security Model docs.
Day 5: Polish CLI (doctor + version), final QA script, prepare release notes.

## 10. Release Criteria (Go / No-Go)
Go if: All Must Fix items resolved; 5 automated tests green; docs present; Stripe events verified end-to-end on test mode; CLI publish dry run successful.
No-Go if: Duplicate webhook unresolved, or quota enforcement unreliable, or secure engine instability observed during stress test.

## 11. Risk Mitigation
- If multi-language not ready: Marketing copy: “JavaScript secure sandbox today; Python & more coming.”
- If embeddings slow on first run: Add progress + caching & suggest `ctx index` pre-warm command (future feature).
- If Stripe latency spikes: Queue updates (Firestore write throttling) & rely on periodic reconciliation job.

## 12. Post-MVP Growth Hooks
- Execution insights leaderboard (aggregate anonymous patterns).
- AI-assisted repair suggestions (use memory-improvement suggestions surfaced proactively).
- Team shared memory space + permission model.

## 13. Conclusion
You’re close: core primitives exist and only a focused hardening pass stands between you and a credible MVP. Prioritize correctness (Stripe + quotas), authenticity in capability claims, and a frictionless first 60 seconds (install → run code → see value). After that, incremental delight layers (semantic insights, memory intelligence) will compound user retention.
